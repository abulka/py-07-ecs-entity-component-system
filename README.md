# ECS - Entity Component System - Experimentation

This is a simple project to experiment with the ECS pattern in Python.

## ECS

The ECS pattern is a way to structure your code in a way that separates the data from the logic. This is done by creating entities that are composed of components. The components are just data, and the entities are just a collection of components. The systems are the logic that operates on the entities.

## Running the code

To run the code, you need to have Python 3 installed. You can run the code by executing the following command:

```bash
uv run main.py
```
